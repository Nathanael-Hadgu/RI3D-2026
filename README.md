## Robot in 3 days 2026: _FRC First Age_
### Bison robotics 
_Robot in 3 Days_ is a project where we take the typical 6 week FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) challenge season 
and condense it to **3 days**. The project is focused on mentoring hundreds of teams and high school students through 
YouTube, technical papers, and social media. For this year we tackled the challange of a fast cycling robot that uses 
arcade steering with a hooded shooter provided to us by AndyMark to help with accuracy this year we also got help from 
Endevor to have a apriltag vision system to help with aligning. For information on the design and manufacutring process, 
go to our youtube [Bison Robotics](https://www.youtube.com/@bisonrobotics) and check out the _2026 First Age_ season.
